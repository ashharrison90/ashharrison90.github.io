Optimising warhead lethality through computer modelling and data analysis.

Having to occasionally say the first half of that sentence out loud is part of the reason why I decided a career in weapons wasn't for me.

However, my time at QinetiQ gave me the opportunity to solidify my programming knowledge (more Python, R and shell) and gain invaluable client experience.

export default ({ children, className, innerRef }) => (
  <JobSummary
    ref={innerRef}
    className={className}
    {...metadata}
    icon={<Qinetiq />}
  >
    {children}
  </JobSummary>
