This site should:\n\n- be written in TypeScript\n- use some new bootstrap (i.e. not Create React App)\n- function as a place to demonstrate **production quality** code\n\nThat last point is probably overkill. I don't know many personal sites with a robust set of unit and end-to-end tests, but that's my intention here.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThat brings us on to some implementation decisions.\n\nIn terms of static site generators, there are [quite a few options](https://jamstack.org/generators). However, after deciding to stick with React, it starts to become a bit of a two horse race between [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).\n\nI ended up choosing Next.js, primarily because of it's flexibility. Whilst Gatsby is designed purely as a static site generator, the main focus of Next.js is server side rendering. It just so happens to _also_ offer static site generation.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src='/assets/blog/building-this-site/peopleUsingNext.png' alt=\"Companies using Next.js\"/>\n  <figcaption>Lots of companies are starting to adopt Next.js</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo if this site ever evolves to the point where it needs a dynamic backend, it can! At the same time, I also gain experience with a framework that [a lot of companies are now using.](https://nextjs.org/showcase) Win-win.\n","coverImage":"/assets/blog/building-this-site/code.png","date":"2021-05-09T15:40:07.322Z","excerpt":"My motivations for building a personal site, and some lessons learned along the way.","slug":"building-this-site","title":"Building this site"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
