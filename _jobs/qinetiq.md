As part of the Weapons Technologies team, my work at QinetiQ revolved around the design of warheads for external clients such as the MOD, Astrium, BAE Systems, and Raytheon. This was mostly done via computer modelling and data analysis, with occasional live testing at specialised sites.

This allowed me to further develop my programming experience through shell, Python and R scripting, as well as gaining invaluable client experience.

Ultimately I decided a career in weapons wasn't for me. Talking about 'improving lethality' became a bit too surreal after a while.
