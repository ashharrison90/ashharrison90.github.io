Based in the Weapons Technologies team, a large proportion of the work revolved around the design, modelling and testing of warheads for external clients such as the MOD, Astrium, BAE Systems, and Raytheon. This provided a huge amount of client engagement, as well as developing experience with Linux and Python.
